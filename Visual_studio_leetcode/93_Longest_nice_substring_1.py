# Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
# At each level of recursion, we may split the string around a character and recurse on two substrings.

# In the worst case, the split happens one character at a time (like quicksort with worst pivot), creating O(n) recursive calls.

# Each call creates a new substring of size up to O(n), and constructing set(s) takes O(n) time.

# Thus, the total time is bounded by:

# T(n) = T(k) + T(n-k-1) + O(n) \Rightarrow O(n^2)
# ]

# ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity: O(n)
# Recursive call stack: Can go up to depth O(n) in the worst case.

# Set used in each call takes O(n) space.

# Substring creation (s[:i], s[i+1:]) also takes O(n) space overall (not reused).

# So, the total auxiliary space is O(n) (stack + set + substring).
