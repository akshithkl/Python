# ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity: O(n)

# The right pointer r goes from 0 to n-1, so it runs n times.

# The left pointer l also only moves forward and never backward.

# Therefore, in total, both pointers traverse the array once, making the overall complexity O(n).

# üß† Space Complexity: O(1)

# No extra space is used apart from a few variables (l, r, total, res).

# The input list nums is not modified or duplicated.
