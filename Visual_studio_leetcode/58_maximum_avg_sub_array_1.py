# ‚è± Time Complexity: O(n)
# sum(nums[:k]) takes O(k) time.

# The loop from k to len(nums) takes O(n - k) time.

# So, total time = O(k + (n - k)) = O(n)

# üß† Space Complexity: O(1)
# You're using only a few variables (window, max_avg), regardless of the size of the input.

# No extra space proportional to input size.
