# âœ… Time Complexity:
# O(2^T), where T = target

# In the worst case, every recursive call either includes a candidate (again) or skips to the next candidate.

# This gives a binary recursion tree, with a maximum depth proportional to the target (in the worst case, like [1,1,1,...] summing to target).

# So the number of possible combinations is exponential in target.

# ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity:
# O(T) (for recursion stack)
# O(R Ã— L) (for result list)

# Recursive stack can go as deep as target in the worst case ([1,1,1,...] up to target).

# Result list (res) stores all valid combinations:

# Let R be the number of valid combinations.

# Let L be the average length of each combination.
